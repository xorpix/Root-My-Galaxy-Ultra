 * What a sweep deletes, what it refuses to, and what it is able to say about it.
 *
 * The two rules worth pinning are the ones whose failure is silent. A sweep set that includes the
 * daemon breaks this boot's own repair actions, and a sweep that cannot see a run in flight deletes the
 * payload that run is executing - neither shows up as a failed assertion unless it is written as one.

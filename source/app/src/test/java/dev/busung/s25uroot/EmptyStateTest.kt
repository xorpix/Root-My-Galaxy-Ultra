/**
 * What the app says when a list has nothing in it.
 *
 * An empty area and a broken one look the same, so a page that is empty for a reason has to say which
 * reason and what would fill it. The two emptinesses are not the same thing and are not answered the same
 * way: a list that is empty because nothing has happened yet needs a way to go and make something happen,
 * while a list that is empty because a filter excluded everything needs a way to undo the filter - and
 * naming every control to change by hand is not that way.
 *
 * Held as a rule over every empty card rather than one assertion per card, so a fourth empty state added
 * later cannot be a blank area that looks broken.

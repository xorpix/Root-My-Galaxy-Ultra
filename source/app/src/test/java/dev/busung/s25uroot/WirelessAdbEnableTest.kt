/**
 * What a wireless-debugging write actually did.

 * The rule exists because `Settings.Global.putInt` returns without complaint whether or not the device
 * honours the value. Reading it back is the only way to know, and the case that matters is the one where
 * the write was made and the setting did not move: that is a device refusing the change, and the user
 * needs to be told to use the switch instead of watching the app wait for a port that will never exist.

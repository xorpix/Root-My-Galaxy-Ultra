/**
 * What a manifest is allowed to say about where its artifacts live.
 *
 * The rule is a list of repositories, and it is tested because getting it wrong does not look like a
 * rule failing: a catalog that names somewhere the list does not cover is refused *whole*, and the first
 * screen the app shows says "Support check failed" about a source that is perfectly reachable. That is
 * what this fork's own default source did - its feed is the upstream catalog with a different owner, so
 * every artifact URL in it names the upstream repository - and nothing but a test on the rule keeps it
 * from happening again the next time a feed is copied.

 * The two answers a Shizuku refusal can be continued with.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the part that two callers have to agree on: the boot notification writes an
 * extra and the run screen reads it, and the screen decides what to do from [RunAnswer] alone. If those
 * two drifted, an action labelled "Run without Shizuku" could start a run that waits for Shizuku - a
 * button that does the opposite of what it says, which is worse than no button.

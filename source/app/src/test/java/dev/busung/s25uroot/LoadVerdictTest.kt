/**
 * Which of the two accounts a finished late-load is judged by.
 *
 * The case this exists for is the second one: KernelSU's driver fd is opened through a `reboot`
 * magic and then checked for a version and two flag bits, so a module that loaded while that route
 * is refused exits non-zero with the kernel holding it. Judging the run on the exit code alone
 * recorded that as a failed load, which left no receipt for the boot and no manager to hand over.

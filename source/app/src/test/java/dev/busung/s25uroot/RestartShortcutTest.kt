/**
 * The launcher's restart shortcuts, and the three files that have to agree for either to work.
 *
 * The action is a string written twice - once in the shortcut XML the launcher reads, once in the constant the
 * activity compares against - and nothing in the build joins them. A mismatch is invisible to the compiler and
 * to every run of the app from a tap: the long press opens the app and does nothing else, which reads as a
 * shortcut that is broken rather than as a typo.
 *
 * The same for the shortcut's own attributes: the launcher requires a short label and an icon, and one that is
 * missing an attribute it requires is not an error anywhere - the entry simply does not appear.
 *
 * Every test walks every shortcut in the file rather than the first one, because the second one was added
 * after the first and a test that read only the first would have passed with an unusable entry beside it.

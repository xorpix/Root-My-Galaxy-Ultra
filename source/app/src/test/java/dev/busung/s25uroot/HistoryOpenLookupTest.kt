/**
 * What the History page does with a run something asked it to open.
 *
 * The failure this guards against is silent in both directions, which is why it is worth a test rather than a
 * comment. A tap on a run's notification names a run, and this page opened it only if the copy of the history
 * it happened to be holding already contained that id - which it may not, because a boot run writes its entry
 * from its own process and the app can have been open before that run began. The tap then did nothing, and
 * what stayed on screen was whatever run was there before: a live install reading as the previous failure. The
 * other half is the follow: a record whose stored verdict says failed can still be the run being written right
 * now, because a launch closes every unfinished entry it thinks was interrupted.

/**
 * Which manager version the app offers, from the three facts that can decide one.
 *
 * The order is the whole rule and it is what these walk: a version the user named cannot be taken back
 * by anything the app resolves, the payload's KernelSU is offered when nothing is named (it is the
 * daemon the next run stages, so its own manager is the only one certainly built against it), and the
 * flavour's own release is what is left when neither says.
 *
 * [ManagerOffer.assetNameKnown] is asserted beside each one because it decides whether a tap needs a
 * request at all: only the flavour's release has a file name the app knows.

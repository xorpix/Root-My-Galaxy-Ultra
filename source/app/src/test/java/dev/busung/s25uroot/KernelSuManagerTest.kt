/**
 * Finding a manager whose package name is not the published one.
 *
 * KernelSU-Next's spoofed manager build rewrites `com.rifsxd.ksunext` to three random words, freshly
 * generated on every release, so the app can never hold that name. What it can hold is the label,
 * which the spoof does not touch, and this is the decision that turns the two into a flavour.
 *
 * The unknown case matters as much as the others: a package that carries a KernelSU daemon but says
 * nothing about which project it is belongs to neither row rather than being guessed into one.

/**
 * Where a tap on a notification about a run lands, and the two records that decide it.
 *
 * The bug this covers is not a crash: it is a tap that opens a screen about a *different* run, or offers to
 * start a second install while the notification was describing the first. That is why most of this is read
 * off the sources - the wrong destination compiles, reads correctly in a diff, and is only visible on a phone.

/**
 * The two package names this app has, and the rule that keeps them apart.
 *
 * A fork can move the id it installs under without moving the Java package it is written in, which is
 * what this one did - so from here on the same string means two different things depending on where it
 * appears. `package dev.busung.s25uroot` at the top of a file is correct and always will be. The same
 * text inside a command that grants a permission, a resource that names the app a shortcut opens, or a
 * lookup for an installed package is a bug: it compiles, it runs, and it is aimed at an app that is not
 * this one.
 *
 * That is the class of mistake this test exists for, and it is not hypothetical. This fork's rename left
 * four such references behind - a shortcut resource pointing at the other install, an update check
 * reading the other install's releases, and a grant command naming a package that is not installed - and
 * the only reason they were caught is that they were looked for by hand, twice.
 *
 * ## What it says, and what it cannot
 *
 * It reads text, so it can say where the old prefix appears and hold every use to a fixed list of the
 * ones that are not this app's identity. What it cannot say is that an allowed use is *correct*: no grep
 * can prove that an action string is only ever sent to this app, and the sweep's own catalogue has the
 * same limit for the same reason. That claim is made by the tests next to the code that sends one - and
 * for the shortcut resource, by [RestartShortcutTest], which reads the same value out of the build.

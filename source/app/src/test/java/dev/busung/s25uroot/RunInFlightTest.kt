/**
 * The record of a run in flight, and the two places that refuse to start a second one beside it.
 *
 * The record is read by processes that did not write it and outlives the process that did, so what it means
 * has to hold when the facts around it are stale: a pid that has been handed out again, a boot that has
 * ended, a field an older build never wrote. Every one of those is a case here.

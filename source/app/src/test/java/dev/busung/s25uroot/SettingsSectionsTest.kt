/**
 * The settings page's sections, and the two ways a closed one can go wrong silently.
 *
 * A card another screen points at that no section claims is a jump that opens nothing and scrolls nowhere -
 * the person is put on the settings page with no row to look at, and nothing anywhere says so. And a
 * section whose cards are drawn outside its guard is a section that looks closed while its switches are
 * still on screen, which is how a collapse feature ends up trusted less than no feature at all.
 *
 * Both are checked here rather than on a device, because both are properties of the source.

/**
 * The network wait's three endings, and the order it decides them in.
 *
 * The wait is the longest one in the app - five minutes - and it holds a foreground service and a wake
 * lock while it runs, so every way it can end is worth pinning rather than only the happy one. The
 * `Context` overload cannot be driven from here at all, which is why the loop takes its own reading and
 * is tested through that.
 *
 * The tick is a millisecond here rather than a second: what these assert is how many times the loop
 * asked and in what order, not how long it took.

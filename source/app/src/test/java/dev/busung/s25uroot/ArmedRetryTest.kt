/**
 * What an armed retry means for the boot the phone is in.
 *
 * The rule is worth testing because getting it wrong is silent in both directions: call a retry that is
 * waiting on a reboot "ready to start" and the card offers the very attempt the user turned down when
 * they chose the restart; call one that is waiting on a tap "waiting on a restart" and the install is
 * never offered at all, on the device that has no cached payload for the boot gate to run.

/**
 * The one thing that happens on `BOOT_COMPLETED`: decide whether this boot gets an automatic
 * install, and start the gate that performs it.
 *
 * The receiver is kept deliberately small - no payload hashing, no file walking, no network - because
 * it runs inside the framework's boot broadcast with a time budget it does not control. The gate does
 * the real work in its own process, where being slow costs nothing but its own start.
 *
 * The Shizuku start is collected before the install checks return early for the same reason it always
 * has been: a boot that already has root is exactly the boot where Shizuku can be brought back
 * without a cable, so it must not be skipped along with the install.

/**
 * How long after a boot a run waits before the exploit starts.
 *
 * The wait is measured from the boot, not from the moment the run was asked for: a device that has
 * already been up longer than the requirement waits not at all, and one that was rebooted ten seconds
 * ago waits the rest. That is the point of the gate, because what it is protecting is the state of a
 * freshly booted device, and a race attempted while the system is still settling fails for reasons the
 * payload cannot fix.
 *
 * The default is not zero. The exploit this app runs has a racy stage that a cold device makes worse,
 * and the wait costs two minutes once per boot against a failed attempt that costs the whole run. It
 * is a floor rather than a hard block: [InstallViewModel.skipBootSettle] ends the wait on the user's
 * word, because someone who knows their device just booted cleanly is better informed than a constant.
 *
 * The payload keeps a window of its own over the same boot, and it is told this run's value rather
 * than a constant of its own: see [payloadQuietWindowSeconds]. Two gates are fine when one of them is
 * derived from the other, and were not fine while both were settings nobody had compared.

/**
 * The kernel's pipe page budget, and what a payload that runs into it looks like.
 *
 * A pipe in this exploit is not a small one: the race is built on a pipe buffer whose pages are
 * charged to the user's budget (`fs.pipe-user-pages-soft` and `-hard`), and the budget is per boot
 * rather than per process. An attempt that spends it leaves the next attempt unable to allocate at
 * all, which the payload reports as a kernel refusal on the sizing call and which the app, until now,
 * reported as a generic exploit failure. Every later attempt in that boot fails the same way, so the
 * symptom is a phone that "stopped working" after the first failure rather than a run that failed
 * once - and the answer is a restart, not another attempt.
 *
 * The check is a pair read from the payload's own output, not a guess from a single word. A payload
 * prints its pipe limits as ordinary information (that is what the pre-check in the reference
 * implementation is for), and those lines are not a diagnosis; what is a diagnosis is one of those
 * limits appearing in the same line as a refusal.

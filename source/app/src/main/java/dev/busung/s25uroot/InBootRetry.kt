/**
 * A retry in the boot that already ran one, after a wait.
 *
 * A failed attempt leaves state behind: the payload's own oracle and slab state, and a pipe page
 * budget the shell user has already spent. A second attempt made straight away usually fails on that
 * state rather than on the exploit, which is why "try again" is the least reliable of the three
 * answers a failed run has.
 *
 * The wait is a measurement rather than a guess. Two independent projects that drive this payload hit
 * the same thing and wrote the same answer into their code: the state clears itself in about a
 * minute. One chains whole payload relaunches with a 60-second gap between them and records the
 * observation that produced it; the other wraps that in a further loop with the same wait, after
 * refusing to keep hammering a boot whose attempt count has run out.
 *
 * So this sits between the other two: restarting is still the best odds, retrying at once is still the
 * fastest, and this is the one that pays a minute for a cleaner boot without giving up the session.

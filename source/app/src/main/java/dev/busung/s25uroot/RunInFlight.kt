/**
 * Which process is on a run right now, in a form this app's *other* processes can read.
 *
 * A run can be started from two places and they are not in the same process: the boot gate installs
 * from its own `:autoroot_gate` service, and the screens install from the UI process. Every guard the
 * app has against a second attempt - the screen's own `installJob`, the gate's one-attempt-per-boot
 * claim - is a guard about its own process, so neither of them can tell the other that it is busy. For
 * a run that means an overlapping attempt, which the app has always been able to have; for a cleanup
 * it means something worse, because a sweep that cannot see a run in flight deletes the payload that
 * run is about to execute.
 *
 * So this is a record rather than a lock: a run writes down which process is running it, and anything
 * that wants to know asks. Deliberately not a lock, because a process that dies mid-run would leave a
 * lock held and nothing would ever be swept again - the record carries the process that wrote it, and a
 * pid that no longer exists is a run that no longer exists.
 *
 * The boot token travels with the pid for the same reason it does everywhere else in this app: a pid is
 * only unique within one boot, and a record that outlived its boot would name a stranger.

 * A manager APK's signing key, as ReSukiSU's kernel identifies it.
 *
 * Not a package name and not a version: the kernel decides who its manager is by reading the APK's
 * v2 signature out of the file, so the identity it holds is this pair - the certificate block's size
 * and the SHA-256 of the certificate. Everything else about the APK can change without the kernel
 * noticing, which is exactly why a manager can be rebuilt, or shipped for a different ABI, and still
 * be recognised.
 *
 * [size] is an `Int` rather than the `Long` a file size would be, because that is what the kernel's
 * own command carries (`u32`) and the range is bounded at both ends: it refuses anything under `0x100`
 * or over `0x1000`.

 * The line `ksud` prints when it is asked about a signature, in either of the two forms it uses.

 * dynamic-manager get` writes it in decimal (`size: 768, hash: …`), which is a difference worth
 * parsing rather than a difference worth avoiding: the two questions are answered by different parts
 * of the daemon and only one of them is the app's to choose. Both are read here so the two can be
 * compared, and so the value that goes back out is the decimal one the `set` command's own argument
 * parser accepts.
 *
 * The hash is 64 characters because that is what the kernel validates character by character
 * (`0-9a-f`), and because the daemon's `set` takes exactly 64 bytes. A line that does not carry one
 * is not a signature, so this returns null rather than a guess - an unreadable answer and a manager
 * with no key are different states and the screens say so differently.
 *
 * A size of zero is not a signature: it is what the kernel's own struct starts at, and treating it
 * as one would let an empty answer read as a registration. And the hash is bounded on both sides,
 * so a longer run of hex characters is not read as its first 64 - the kernel's own check is that
 * there are exactly 64 of them, and a parse that accepted more would be lenient about the one thing
 * the kernel is strict about.

 * trust as its manager, so it is a tap on a settings row that says so, not something a root install
 * does on the way past.

 * clears it. The daemon keeps the pair in its own file and re-applies it on the way up, which is why

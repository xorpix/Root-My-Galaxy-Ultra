/**
 * The one-shot retry a failed run can leave behind, and what it means right now.
 *
 * The retry is stored as the kernel boot it was armed in rather than as a flag, because the whole
 * promise is "after a reboot" - a run armed while the phone is up must not be started by the same boot
 * that armed it. Two things follow from that, and both are why this type exists:
 *
 * - Until the reboot happens, the retry is waiting on something the user controls, and the only thing
 *   worth offering them is the way to take it back.
 * - After the reboot happens, it is waiting on *this app*: the boot gate runs it by itself only where
 *   there is a cached payload to run from, since at boot there is no network to fetch one. On a device
 *   whose last run never succeeded there is no cache, which is exactly the device that was told
 *   "restart and retry". So for that one, a run is owed and only a tap can give it.
 *
 * It also overrides root on boot, deliberately: a retry is a request the user made by hand, and the
 * gate's rule is that either way of asking gets the boot's single attempt. That override is the reason
 * this is on screen at all - it used to be invisible, so a phone that rooted itself at boot looked like
 * a setting that had been ignored.

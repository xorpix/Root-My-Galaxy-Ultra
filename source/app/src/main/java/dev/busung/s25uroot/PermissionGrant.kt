/**
 * Giving this app the one permission it cannot take for itself, over whatever shell the device offers.
 *
 * `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` is development-flagged: the documented way to grant it is a cable and
 * `pm grant`, or `adb install -g`. That is not the only way in, and this object exists for the ones
 * that need no computer. The `shell` user is allowed to run `pm grant` on any package - it is the
 * mechanism `adb shell pm grant` itself uses - so a running Shizuku server is enough, and so is a
 * pairing with the device's own wireless debugging.
 *
 * The transports are tried cheapest first, and the order is the whole design:
 *
 * 1. **A root shell**, which covers both KernelSU's `su` and the bootstrap helper's daemon, so it works
 *    in the moment after an exploit and on a device where nothing else is running.
 * 2. **Shizuku's own shell.** No root needed, no cable needed, and it is the transport a device with
 *    neither root nor a pairing can still have.
 * 3. **The device's own adbd**, over a stored pairing. Last, and partly because of its own cost, but
 *    mostly because the permission is what lets this app turn wireless debugging on by itself - so this
 *    route only exists on a device where it is already on.
 *
 * Every attempt is verified by reading the permission back rather than by its exit code. `pm grant` can
 * report success while granting nothing, and the permission is the only thing that decides whether the
 * next screen works.

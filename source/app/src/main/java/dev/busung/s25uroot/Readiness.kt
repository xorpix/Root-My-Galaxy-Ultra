/**
 * What the Overview status line can honestly say about the two things a run needs.
 *
 * Readiness is two independent facts, so it is two fields rather than one verdict: a device can have
 * KernelSU loaded and no usable Shizuku, or a working Shizuku and nothing loaded, and a single "ready /
 * not ready" would have to throw away which of those it was - the same collapsing that once made a
 * settings row offer to start a service that was already running.
 *
 * [KernelSuStatus] is three-valued on purpose. The readings behind it are exactly the ones Samsung's
 * policy denies to app domains, so "I could not look" is a real outcome and not the same answer as "it
 * is not there". Reporting the first as the second is what once had the app tell a rooted phone it was
 * unrooted, and a status line is where that is most tempting: it wants a single word.

 * Which manager apps the phone has, per flavour.
 *
 * KernelSU being loaded and its manager being installed are separate facts, and neither implies the
 * other: root can be in the kernel with no app to manage it, and a manager can be installed on a phone
 * with nothing loaded - which is the state a fresh install leaves, and the one worth seeing before a run
 * finishes rather than after.
 *
 * Every flavour is reported rather than only the configured one. They are different apps that cannot
 * both be in the kernel, so which of them is actually on the phone is part of the picture, and a manager
 * installed for another flavour is exactly what an attempt to open "the manager" then fails to find.
 *
 * Held as the set of flavours found rather than one field each, so a flavour added to [KernelSuFlavor] is
 * a row on the card and a line here without a second place to remember - the shape this was written in
 * had a field per flavour, and the two of them had already drifted once.

 * has no idea what any page is doing: the list, its state and its direction all belong to the page. The one
 * mechanism that crosses that line without threading a parameter through five screens is nested scroll, which
 * a scrolling list already dispatches to every ancestor that asks for it. So the shell asks, and a page does
 * not have to know that anything is listening.
 *
 * Attached to the pages rather than to the whole screen, which matters: the sheets and dialogs are drawn as
 * siblings of the pages, and scrolling a payload list inside one of them is not a page moving under the bar.

 * network.
 *
 * The order is by how much the app can see for itself. **Root** starts Shizuku's own starter, so the
 * app watches the process it started. **Local adb** does the same thing in the shell the device's own
 * adbd hands out, reached over loopback, which needs no root. **The token** is a request to another app
 * that can only be answered by waiting for a binder.
 *
 * Both of the no-root routes need one thing that root does not, and it is easy to miss because it is not
 * part of either route's own logic: they go through wireless debugging, and wireless debugging cannot be
 * on without a connected Wi-Fi network ([NetworkReach]). Reaching adbd over loopback is what that route
 * needs instead of a *computer*; it does not remove the network requirement, because the port it dials is
 * published by adbd's TLS listener, which the framework only starts for wireless debugging that it has
 * been able to turn on.

 * request, and Shizuku starting itself at boot - goes through wireless debugging, and the framework keeps
 * wireless debugging off while no Wi-Fi network is connected ([NetworkReach]). So an attempt made in
 * that state is one of a bounded few spent on a question the device cannot answer.
 *
 * Note what this means for a device with no route at all: it is still a device that *could* be brought
 * up by nothing on this side - Shizuku's own boot receiver, which needs wireless debugging, and therefore
 * a network too. Which is why this asks about the network rather than about whether an attempt would be
 * made.
 *
 * Pure, so the matrix can be checked without a device: it is the difference between waiting and a
 * refusal that names the wrong reason, and neither of those states can be produced by hand.

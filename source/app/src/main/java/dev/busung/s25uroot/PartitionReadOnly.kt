/**
 * The optional safeguard that marks the partitions an image could be written to read-only.
 *
 * It exists because of the shape of this app's own success: bootstrap root is real root, granted
 * before anything has verified that the kernel it is running on belongs to the firmware it was built
 * for. The reported failures are people using that window to write a boot or vbmeta image - the kind
 * of write that produces a device that boots to nothing and needs download mode to recover. Setting
 * those devices read-only first means the write fails instead.
 *
 * **On unless turned off**, and the trade is deliberate: what it blocks is not only mistakes. Flashing a
 * kernel image from the phone, a module that writes a partition directly, and a KernelSU install that
 * patches `boot` rather than loading at runtime are all legitimate and all stop working while it is on.
 * The mistake it blocks is the one with no undo - a boot or vbmeta write that leaves the device needing
 * download mode - so the protection is what a first run gets, and turning it off is a decision the
 * person who knows what they intend on their own device makes, per device, in Settings. It is per boot
 * either way: `blockdev --setro` affects the running kernel, so a reboot - the normal state for
 * flashing - clears it.
 *
 * The script lives in assets because it runs as a file with bootstrap root, and the only thing the app
 * reads back is how many devices it managed to set.
 *
 * It is also the only place that can say the protection *caused* a failure, which is why [refusedByReadOnly]
 * lives here rather than at the screens that report failures: a message that blamed the switch for a
 * write refused by something else would talk people out of the guard that was working.

 * Kept here, the two compose in one place instead of one filtering the other's output at the call
 * site, and the empty list has a nameable cause: the device filter, the search, or a catalog that

 * Whether a target is what someone typed.

 * Every field a row shows is searched, plus the flavour, because the sheet's text is the only account
 * of a target at a glance: a model, a kernel release, the source it came from and the KernelSU it
 * stages are all things someone arrives holding - "S928B", "6.1.99", "next", "3.4.0" - and none of
 * them is the profile's name.
 *
 * The declared KernelSU version is searched as a field rather than left to the display name, which
 * happens to spell it out on some entries and not others: "which of these stages the 3.4.0 I have a
 * manager for" is a question someone can arrive with, and it should not depend on how the entry was
 * named.
 *
 * Case-insensitive, and a substring rather than a word: a kernel version is typed by its parts, and
 * nobody types the whole of `6.1.99-android14-11`.

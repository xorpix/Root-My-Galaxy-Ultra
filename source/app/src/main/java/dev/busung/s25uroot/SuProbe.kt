/**
 * Asks KernelSU itself whether root is live, by running `su`.
 *
 * [NativeProbe] reads `/sys/module/kernelsu` and `/proc/modules`, and Samsung's SELinux policy denies
 * both to app domains once the modules are loaded and the system has locked down - so a device with
 * root working perfectly can still be told, in the app's own words, that KernelSU is not installed.
 * That answer is worse than no answer: it is what makes a boot automation decide a rooted boot needs
 * rooting again.
 *
 * The app is the KernelSU manager the payload crowns, and KernelSU's own compatibility layer is what
 * answers `su` for the callers it allows. So a shell that answers `uid=0` is KernelSU saying it is
 * live, which is a direct answer rather than an inference from files a policy may hide.
 *
 * Absence is reported as absence, never as success: an app that is not the granted manager cannot run
 * `su` at all, and that is indistinguishable from a device with no root - which is the safe way round,
 * because the caller's next step is an install that needs the same allowance anyway.

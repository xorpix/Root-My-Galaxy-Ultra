 * What the Logs tab is being asked to show, in the two questions it is asked in.
 *
 * One object rather than two pieces of screen state, because the two are not independent: a line is shown
 * when it clears the floor *and* matches the text, and held apart they would be applied in two places that
 * could disagree about the same line.
 *
 * Pure, so the answers worth checking - what the Errors floor lets through, that turning it off only lowers
 * the floor it raised - are checked without a device.
 *
 * There used to be a third question, a set of tags drawn as a row of chips with a count beside each one.
 * It is **gone**, and deliberately not replaced by a smaller version of itself: the row was the tallest
 * thing above the log, and for the question it actually answered - where is the noise - the text field is
 * one word away.

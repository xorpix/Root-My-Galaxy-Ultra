/**
 * Which KernelSU the app installs and drives.
 *
 * KernelSU, KernelSU-Next and ReSukiSU are separate projects with separate kernels, separate managers
 * and separate daemons, and no two of them can be in the kernel at once: each hooks the same syscall
 * paths, so a boot carries one of them or neither. That is why this is stored for the app rather than
 * passed to one run, and why changing it has to wait for a restart.
 *
 * The ids are the feed's own. A payload entry declares `"flavor": "kernelsu-next"`, and this decides
 * whether a run may use that entry. An entry that says nothing is [Default], which is what keeps every
 * manifest written before flavours existed readable.

 *    may silently take that choice back.
 * 2. **The version the resolved payload declares.** This is the fact the app was missing: the payload
 *    stages a specific KernelSU daemon, that daemon's own manager is the only one that is certainly
 *    built against it, and the release the app offered instead was a number compiled into the app -
 *    which is how an app came to hand out a manager its own kernel was never built against, and then
 *    warn the user about the mismatch it had just created.
 * 3. **The flavour's own release.** Nothing to go on: no payload resolved yet, or one whose entry does
 *    not declare a version (every entry written before the feed carried the field).
 *
 * Pure, so the order can be tested without a device, a feed or a preference file.

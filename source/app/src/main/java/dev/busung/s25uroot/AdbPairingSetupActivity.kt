/**
 * The way pairing is started, and the way it is *forced* to start again.
 *
 * The second part is what makes this an activity rather than a plain service call. A stored pairing
 * can be stale in a way nothing on this side can see: the device may have discarded this app from its
 * paired-device list, while the key and the flag are still on disk. Retrying then looks like a no-op,
 * because a service that trusts the flag has nothing to do. Asking for a re-pair clears the flag
 * first, so the next pairing starts from the device's own state rather than from the app's record of
 * it.

     * Wireless debugging first, because a pairing service only exists while it is on, and a freshly
     * set-up device has it off. [TemporaryWirelessAdb] is the same window the transport uses for a
     * run - the failsafe alarm is armed before the switch moves, and the pairing service turns it off
     * again when the transaction ends - so this cannot leave a shell port open. It runs off the main
     * thread because the root route to that setting starts a shell, and it is allowed to fail: a
     * device with neither the permission nor root gets the switch by hand, which is what the last step
     * is for.
     *
     * Developer options last, because the six-digit code only exists inside Android's own pairing
     * dialog, and that dialog only exists there. Opening it is the whole reason this is an activity
     * rather than a bare service call.

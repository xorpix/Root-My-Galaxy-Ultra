/**
 * The settings page, as the parts it is read by.
 *
 * The page is long enough that finding one switch in it meant scrolling past everything else, and most
 * visits are for one thing. So each part is a section that can be collapsed to a single heading - the
 * headings of consecutive collapsed sections being one dense card - and stays as it was left.
 *
 * Every section is **open** unless it is collapsed, and the preference stores the collapsed ones: nothing
 * stored then means the whole page open, which is where a settings page belongs, and the one arrangement the
 * page cannot be caught in is the one where eight rows stand for switches nobody can see. [icon] is the
 * glyph a row is found by at a glance, which is what makes the closed page readable at all.
 *
 * [targets] is what makes a closed section safe for the cards other screens point at. A jump is a scroll to
 * a row's key, and a closed section has no rows at all - so the section that holds a card is the first
 * thing a jump opens, and the list of cards is kept here rather than inferred from the page, where the two
 * could drift apart one card at a time.

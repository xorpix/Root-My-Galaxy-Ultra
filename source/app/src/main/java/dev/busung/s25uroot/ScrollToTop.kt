 * Every scrolling page goes through this instead of placing the button itself, because the button has to be
 * a sibling of the list rather than a thing the list draws: it floats over the content and must not scroll
 * with it. The state is the caller's, since a page that jumps to a card needs to drive the same state this
 * draws over.
 *
 * The list's own bottom padding is extended by the room the button and the floating navigation bar need, so
 * the last card cannot end up sitting under either. Pages keep their own padding and do not have to know
 * what is drawn over them.

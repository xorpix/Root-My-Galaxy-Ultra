/**
 * A live connection to the device's own adbd over wireless debugging.
 *
 * Opening one is the whole bring-up: wireless debugging on if it is off, the published port, and
 * authentication with the key this app paired. Commands run as `u:r:shell:s0`, which is what a run
 * needs from a transport - and unlike the app's own process, that context can reach the places a
 * payload is staged in.
 *
 * The failures are named rather than wrapped in one error, because the three of them need different
 * responses from whoever is reading: a missing key means pairing has to happen again, a missing port
 * means the setting is off or adbd has not published it yet, and a refused certificate means the
 * device has forgotten this app and pairing has to happen again *on the device side*.

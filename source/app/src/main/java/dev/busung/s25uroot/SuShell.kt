/**
 * A root shell the app opens for itself, by asking KernelSU's `su` directly.
 *
 * [KernelSuRuntime.rootShell] originally had one route: the Shizuku server, which is a fine route and
 * the quiet one, but it is not always there. It needs Shizuku running *and* this app granted by it, and
 * when either is missing a device with KernelSU loaded and working perfectly gets told, in the app's own
 * words, that "KernelSU root is not available for this boot" - a sentence that is false about the phone
 * and useless to whoever reads it, because the thing that is actually missing is a door this app can
 * open for itself.
 *
 * That door is `su`. KernelSU's own userspace answers `su` for the apps its manager has approved, which
 * for this app is the ordinary state of affairs after a run: the payload's install is what crowns a
 * manager, and the manager is where the user grants root to an app. Asking it directly needs no
 * transport, no binder and no other app running.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately different from a Shizuku command here. The first is that a read can block
 * forever - if KernelSU is waiting for the user to answer its own grant prompt, `su` has not written a
 * byte and will not until it is answered - so the output is read on its own thread and the wait is
 * bounded, and a run that does not answer in time is reported as *no answer* rather than as a failure.
 * The second is that absence is never reported as success: a `su` that cannot be started, or one that
 * exits without root, is a no, and the caller falls through to its own refusal.

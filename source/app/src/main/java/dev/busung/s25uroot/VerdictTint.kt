/**
 * The verdict colours, as the integers the system notification needs.
 *
 * A notification is drawn by Android, not by this app, so it cannot read a Compose theme - and this app has no
 * colours of its own to read: its palette is generated at runtime from the user's accent, or taken from the
 * wallpaper. So the theme hands the four colours over once per composition, and everything outside a
 * composable reads them from here.
 *
 * The fallbacks are the semantic hues a person would name if asked - green, amber, red - and they exist for
 * the one process that can post a notification without ever having drawn a screen: the boot gate's. Its run
 * does not use this notification, so what they are really for is the case where the app's own screen was
 * never composed and a receiver still has something to say.

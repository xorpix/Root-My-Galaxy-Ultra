/**
 * A run happening in another process, drawn on the run screen.
 *
 * The run screen's state is the memory of the process running the run, which is why a boot install has never
 * been showable on it: the gate installs from `:autoroot_gate` and the screens are in the UI process. What the
 * gate *does* publish is its history entry, written as the run goes - and since a live run now writes the phase
 * it has reached beside the log, that entry is enough to draw the same screen: the same bar, the same steps,
 * the same log arriving a line at a time.
 *
 * So a tap on a run notification can open the run screen for a boot install, and not a log: the difference is
 * this type, and nothing about it is a guess. [followedRun] refuses unless the shared record says this entry is
 * the one being written right now, which is the same fact the history screen follows and the same one that
 * spares the entry from being closed as interrupted.
 *
 * What it cannot do is what needs the run's own process: skipping the boot settle, and answering a failure.
 * Those stay where the run is - a screen here offering them would be offering to reach into another process.

     * would be the wrong one in the only way that matters.

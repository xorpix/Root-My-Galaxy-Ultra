/**
 * Stops an open KernelSU manager so the next time it is opened it reads the kernel that is there now.
 *
 * A manager reads the kernel when it starts: whether the driver answers, which modules are mounted,
 * whether its daemon is reachable. One that was already open when this app loaded the module keeps
 * showing what it read *before* the load - no root, no modules, "KernelSU not installed" - which is
 * the same picture as a load that failed, and it is the report this app keeps getting handed when the
 * load worked.
 *
 * Stopping it costs nothing worth weighing: the allowlist lives in KernelSU's own storage, the modules
 * live on disk and in the kernel, and neither is in that process. The app deliberately does not
 * relaunch it, unlike the reference implementation that force-stops and starts the manager again -
 * pulling another app to the front the moment a run finishes would take the screen away from the
 * result the user is reading, and the stale state is cured by the next open either way.
 *
 * Best effort throughout: a manager that is not installed, not running, or behind a shell this device
 * will not hand over is not a failure of the run that just succeeded.

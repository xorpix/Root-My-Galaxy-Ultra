/**
 * The two pure halves of manager registration: reading a key out of the daemon's answers, and
 * building the commands that ask for it.
 *
 * The parser is not a convenience. The daemon prints the same key in two different bases - `debug
 * get-sign` writes the size in hexadecimal and `kernel dynamic-manager get` writes it in decimal -
 * and the `set` command's own argument parser accepts only the decimal one, because it takes a `u32`
 * by `FromStr`. So the value that comes back from one has to be converted to be given to the other,
 * and a mismatch here is a registration that never lands with nothing on screen to say why.
 *
 * The other half is the state mapping, which is where a mistake is expensive rather than merely
 * wrong: "the kernel holds no key" and "nothing could be asked" are one boolean apart, and reading
 * the second as the first tells a user to register a manager on a phone whose kernel was never
 * reached.

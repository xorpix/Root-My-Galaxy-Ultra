/**
 * The bar's answer to a page being scrolled.
 *
 * Two halves, both of which fail quietly. The rule itself is direction: get the sign wrong and the bar leaves
 * when the user reaches for the top and stays put when they dive - which looks like a bar that ignores them,
 * not like a bug. And the wiring is worse, because a connection attached to the wrong node still compiles and
 * still hides the bar: it just does it for the wrong scroll, on a screen that should not have moved it.

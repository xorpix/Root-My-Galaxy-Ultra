 * The back-to-top button: where it is drawn, and the one screen it must give way to.
 *
 * Both rules fail silently if they break. A button drawn by hand on a screen that needs it gated looks
 * right in every screenshot and only misbehaves under a thumb, and the run screen's stand-down is the
 * difference between a control that can be pressed and one that cannot - which is the failure this app has
 * already had once, in a run that could not be stopped.

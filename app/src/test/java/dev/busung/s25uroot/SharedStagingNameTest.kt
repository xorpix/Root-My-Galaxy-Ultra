/**
 * The names in `/data/local/tmp` that both installs can write, and the rule that keeps them apart.
 *
 * The directory is one directory for the whole device - it is not per-app, and it is the only place a
 * shell can reach a file this app stages - so two installs of this app share it exactly as two apps share
 * a home screen. What they must not share is a file: the sweep deletes by name, and a name that means
 * "this app's payload" to one install means the same to the other, so one app's cleanup can take the file
 * the other app's run is about to execute.
 *
 * ## What is written down here, and how it was read
 *
 * [WRITTEN_BY_THE_OTHER_INSTALL] is not a guess. It is the list of paths the other app's own staging
 * code builds - five names, read off its `InstallViewModel` - and it is a fact about *that* app, which
 * is why it cannot be derived from this one. If the other app ever stages a sixth name this list is
 * what has to change, and the fixture is the only place that would know. Two of the five are not really
 * either app's: the payload's own loader reads the daemon at `ksud-s25u-kdp` and the stage copy at
 * `.ksud-stage`, so both installs must use them and neither may rename them.
 *
 * ## What this file covers, and what is next door
 *
 * The staging half: nothing this app writes may be a name the other install also writes. The sweep half
 * - that the names left alone are exactly the ones written down here - is [StagingSweepTest]'s, next to
 * the code that decides it, and the identity half is [InstallIdentityTest]'s.

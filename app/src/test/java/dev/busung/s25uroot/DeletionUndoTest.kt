/**
 * Which deletions ask first, and which offer a way back instead.
 *
 * The rule is not "deletions are undoable" - it is that a confirmation and an undo are for different things.
 * A run's log is a file this app wrote and the only copy of it, so removing one is a change to the phone and
 * the entries have to be held before they go. A file this app staged in `/data/local/tmp` is copyable from
 * the payload catalogue, so removing one costs nothing and asking about it charged every cleanup a second tap
 * to protect against a mistake with no consequence.
 *
 * The one case that still asks is the one where the app cannot know what it is removing: a name in the shared
 * temp directory that it did not write. That is what the confirmation is left for, and this pins it that way
 * so a later change cannot widen the one-tap path past the files the app owns.

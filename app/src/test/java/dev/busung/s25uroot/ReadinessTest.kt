/**
 * The mapping behind the Overview status line.
 *
 * The third state is the one worth pinning. A status line wants a single word, and both of the wrong
 * ways to give it one have already cost this app a bug: calling "could not look" a no is what told a
 * rooted phone it was unrooted, and calling a refusal to answer a yes is how a start button came to
 * offer what was already running. So the two readings are kept as they are and the ambiguity is
 * reported as itself.

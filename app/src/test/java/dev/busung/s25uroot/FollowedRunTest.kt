/**
 * The run screen showing a run that is happening in another process.
 *
 * The mistake this covers is quiet in both directions. Following an entry nothing is writing would draw a live
 * bar, a live log and a Stop for a run that is not there - on a screen that has no other way of saying so. And
 * refusing to follow one that *is* being written sends the reader back to a log, which is the thing this was
 * built to stop doing.

 * Whether a retry may run the payload that failed.

 * the attempt itself, into a directory this app shares with every other run of that profile, so they can
 * be gone by the time a retry runs after a reboot. The alternative to a refusal here is a run that
 * installs something the user did not ask for, which is why each reason is asserted rather than just
 * the yes/no.

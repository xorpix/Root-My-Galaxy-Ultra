/**
 * What a refusal says about the three readings behind it.
 *
 * They have nothing in common - the native paths are hidden by policy on this hardware, `su` answers
 * only for the manager KernelSU knows, and the helper prints a report only when the load reached the
 * point of having one - so a single sentence covers a healthy load the app could not see and a load
 * that never happened. The summary is the part that tells them apart.

/**
 * The three states, and the one that used to have nowhere to be.
 *
 * The settings row branched on two facts it never asked about separately - whether a start was in
 * flight, and whether a binder answered - so "Shizuku is up but this app is not allowed to use it" fell
 * through to the same rendering as "Shizuku is not running", and the row kept offering to start a
 * service that was already up. The middle state is the one worth pinning: it is not a start problem.

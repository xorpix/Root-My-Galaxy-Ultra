/**
 * The floating navigation bar: drawn over the pages, and cleared by everything it can cover.
 *
 * Both halves fail silently. A bar back in the scaffold's bottom slot looks identical on screen - it is the
 * same pill in the same place - and the only difference is the empty band it reserves at the bottom of every
 * page, which no screenshot of a full page shows. And a list that does not count the bar is a last row you
 * can only read by scrolling it under the pill, which reads as a layout bug on one screen out of five.
 *
 * Checked here rather than on a device, because both are properties of the source: one file decides where
 * the bar is drawn, and the height it takes is a single value.

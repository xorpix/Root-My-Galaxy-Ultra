/**
 * The flavour logic that decides which KernelSU a run installs.
 *
 * Three of these cover choices that would be silent if they were wrong. A manifest that names an
 * unknown flavour must refuse rather than fall back, because falling back installs the other
 * project's module into a kernel that asked for this one and nothing afterwards would explain it. A
 * spoofed manager build must not be preferred when a plain one is present, because it is the variant
 * that lies about its signature. And a run of the other flavour in a boot that already has one must
 * be refused, because both hook the same syscall paths and a late-load of the second does not
 * displace the first.

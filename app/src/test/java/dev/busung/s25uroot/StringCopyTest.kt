/**
 * The copy in the default strings file, checked for the mistakes that survive a review.
 *
 * A wording pass is read for what it says, and the things that slip through are the ones the eye fills in:
 * a comma with no space after it, two spaces where one belongs, a value that starts with one. All three were
 * in this file at once - `writes,flashing`, `by %2$s`, and an old ` %1$s; %2$s is installed` that opened with
 * a space - and none of them is visible in a diff that shows the line being changed.
 *
 * Only the default file, and only its punctuation: a translation keeps its own conventions, and nothing here
 * can judge whether a sentence says the right thing. What it cannot catch is the reason to read the diff
 * anyway - "could not read" where the passive needs a "be" is grammar, and this is not.

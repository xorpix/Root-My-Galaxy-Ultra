/**
 * The run screen's bar: when it exists, and the two things that have to hold about where its controls are.
 *
 * The rule fails quietly in one direction only - a phase that offers something but is not listed draws no bar,
 * and the screen then has controls nowhere: not on the page any more, and not in the bar either. It is the
 * kind of gap that shows up as a run that cannot be stopped, which is the one thing a hung run needs.
 *
 * The other two are properties of the source and both were bugs once: the controls sat at the end of the
 * scrolling page, so the log ended against them, and the button over the page had to be told where they began
 * - a measurement that had to be taken in the right place to work at all.
 *
 * The third source property is the bar's own container, which is gone: it held the controls inside a rounded
 * band, and every one of them already has a shape.

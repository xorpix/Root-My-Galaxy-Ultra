/**
 * The shape a run of settings cards has to be in.
 *
 * A group is one rounded container: `Top` draws the rounded top and flat bottom, `Middle` is flat both
 * ways, `Bottom` closes it. The compiler is happy with any order, so a card filed as `Top` between two
 * others is invisible until someone looks at the screen - which is exactly how the payloads group came
 * to draw its sources card as the start of a second list.
 *
 * The positions are read out of the sources because that is where the decision is written. A group is
 * drawn inside one composable, so each file is checked on its own.

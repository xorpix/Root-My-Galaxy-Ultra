/**
 * The rules behind "Open setting".
 *
 * A link that lands on the settings page and leaves the reader to find the row is the thing this
 * feature exists to avoid, so the rules are here: which extras are honoured, how far the search for a
 * row walks before it gives up, and where the row is left once it is found. The middle one is worth its
 * own test because it is the part that can fail silently - a search that stops one row short looks
 * exactly like a card that is not there - and the last one because a card that lands behind the heading
 * the jump itself pinned is a jump to a card nobody can read, which looks like a link that did nothing.

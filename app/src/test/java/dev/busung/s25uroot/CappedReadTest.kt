/**
 * How much of an answer this app will read.
 *
 * The bug these exist for was not a parser and not a URL: a version listing was read under a single
 * release's ceiling, so both flavours answered "could not read the published versions" while the app
 * was holding a perfectly good answer it had refused itself. A ceiling is therefore worth a test of its
 * own - both that it reads a page of releases whole, and that it says why when it does not.

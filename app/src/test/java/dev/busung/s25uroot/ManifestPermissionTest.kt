/**
 * The permissions the code actually asks for, against the ones the manifest declares.
 *
 * A missing declaration is not a degraded run: the call throws `SecurityException` at the point of
 * use. In a service that point can be a boot path, where the throw kills the process the app was
 * relying on and the only symptom is the app crashing after a reboot - which is how a wake lock
 * arrived here without `WAKE_LOCK` and the boot gate died a second after it started.
 *
 * Deliberately one-directional: declared-but-unused is not a failure, because a permission can be
 * declared for a code path that is off, and demanding the manifest match the code exactly would make
 * this a style test rather than a correctness one.

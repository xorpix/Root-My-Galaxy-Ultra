/**
 * The check's two contracts: how a stat's errno is read, and that the catalog is the whole list.
 *
 * The errno rule is the one that decides whether a denied read can ever be shown as a clean device,
 * and the catalog rule is the one that decides whether a file this app writes can be missing from the
 * list - either of which would make the check report good news about residue that is still there. Both
 * are testable without a device, which is why they are the two halves that were built that way: the
 * `Context`-free part of the reading is [StagedResidue.readingFor], and the catalog is checked against
 * the sources the same way [ManifestPermissionTest] checks permissions against the manifest.

/**
 * Serializes Shizuku start attempts across this app's processes.
 *
 * Two of them can want a binder at the same time: the boot service starts Shizuku after a reboot, the
 * settings screen starts it when asked, and the automatic install may start it before a run. A
 * process-local mutex covers none of that, because they are not the same process - so the same moment
 * can see two callers conclude "no binder" and launch two servers, which is the one outcome Shizuku's
 * own documentation warns about. The lock is an OS file lock, so it holds across processes and is
 * released by the kernel if the holder dies.
 *
 * A lock that cannot be taken is not treated as a failure: the worst a missing lock costs is a second
 * starter racing one that is already running, and the binder re-probe immediately before each launch
 * catches exactly that.

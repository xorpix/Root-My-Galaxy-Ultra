/**
 * What this app has left in `/data/local/tmp`, read the way a root detector reads it.
 *
 * The app stages there by necessity: the daemon, the helper and the exploit payload have to be
 * executable by a shell, and `/data/local/tmp` is the one directory that is both writable by the
 * transports this app uses and outside the app's own sandbox. The cost of that is that the staging is
 * *public in the way that matters*: the directory is mode `0771`, so any app on the device may reach a
 * path inside it by name, and the files this app leaves there are world-readable. A detector does not
 * need root or a shell to find them - it needs a list of names, and the names this app uses are fixed
 * and published in its own source.
 *
 * That is the whole reason this object exists, and it is why the reading is *this app's own context*
 * rather than a shell's. A shell reading would answer "what is on disk", which is a different and much
 * less interesting question: what matters is what another app can see, and the only honest way to
 * answer that is to look the way one would.
 *
 * ## Why a catalog, and why a listing on top of it
 *
 * `/data/local/tmp` is `drwxrwx--x shell shell`. The `--x` for other is deliberate, and it is exactly
 * the permission this check turns on: an app may traverse the directory but not read it, so it can
 * stat a path it already knows and cannot list the directory to discover one. Asked on this app's own
 * device, `ls /data/local/tmp` answers `Permission denied` while `ls -l /data/local/tmp/ksu-helper`
 * answers with the file. So the check enumerates the paths this app writes, from the same constants
 * the staging code uses - and that alone was the whole answer until it was not enough.
 *
 * What a catalog cannot do is see a name it does not already know: a payload's own `ksu_late_load.log`,
 * a marker written by a script, a file left by anything else at all. On a device where several of
 * those were sitting in the directory the card read "Nothing left", which is the same statement as a
 * clean device and the opposite of the truth - the mistake [ResidueReading.Unreadable] exists to
 * prevent, arrived at by a different route.
 *
 * So the reading has two halves. The names come from [StagedDirectory], which lists the directory
 * *through a shell*: this app's own context may not read the directory, but the `shell` uid that owns
 * it may, and this app already has that door open for the sweep. Anything the listing names that the
 * catalog does not is carried as an extra, and an extra is enough to stop the card reading clean. When
 * no shell answers there is no listing, and the card says the weaker sentence it has earned instead.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not cover
 *
 * The app's own files - the run history, the app log, the cached payloads - are not here. Nothing
 * outside the app can read them, so they are not residue in the sense this is about. The catalog is
 * only the world-readable staging.

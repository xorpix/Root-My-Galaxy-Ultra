/**
 * Wireless debugging as a window, never as device state.
 *
 * The app turns it on to get a shell and turns it off again, because leaving it on leaves a shell
 * port open that the user did not ask for. Two things make that reliable rather than hopeful:
 *
 * - A short grace period between consecutive users. The transport is handed over - the exploit's
 *   session ends and the KernelSU handoff starts within a second or two of it - and tearing adbd down
 *   in that gap would break the handoff that follows.
 * - An alarm armed *before* the setting is turned on, so a process killed during the window still has
 *   something that turns it back off. The alarm is set well past the longest run this app starts, so
 *   the failsafe can never fire while a legitimate run is still using the transport.
 *
 * In-process users are serialized, because two of them can be alive at once (a boot-time Shizuku start
 * and an automatic install): without the lock, whoever finished first would turn wireless debugging off
 * while the other still held an authenticated session.

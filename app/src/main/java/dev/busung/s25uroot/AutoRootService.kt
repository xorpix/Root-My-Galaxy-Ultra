/**
 * The automatic install after a reboot, in its own process.
 *
 * It is a gate rather than a run: what it decides is *whether* this boot gets an automatic attempt,
 * and it answers that with the kernel's boot id, the stored receipt, and the app's own settings. The
 * run itself is the same code the install screen drives, started here with the cached payload and the
 * standalone transport, so an automatic install cannot drift from a manual one.
 *
 * It runs in `:autoroot_gate` so it survives the app's process being started, killed and restarted
 * around it at boot, which is exactly when that happens. Every step is bounded: the whole gate has a
 * deadline, the run has its own cut-offs, and the boot's single attempt is claimed before the run
 * starts so a second `BOOT_COMPLETED` cannot spend it twice.

     * cannot disagree: it decides which payload the run gets - a retry runs the attempt it was armed for,

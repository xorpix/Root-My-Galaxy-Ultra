/**
 * Deleting what the app staged in `/data/local/tmp`.
 *
 * The app leaves files there because it has to - a payload has to be executable by a shell, and that
 * directory is the only place outside the app's sandbox a shell can reach - but nothing requires them
 * to *stay*. A staged daemon is a five-megabyte copy of a file the load already installed, a staged
 * payload is a copy of one the app still holds, and the logs and marker files are read once and never
 * again. What they are worth after the run is one thing only: evidence, to anything that goes looking.
 * This is the code that takes it away.
 *
 * ## Why a shell is needed, and why that decides when this runs
 *
 * The app cannot delete these itself. `/data/local/tmp` is mode `0771` owned by `shell`, so the app's
 * uid may traverse it and may not write in it - which is the same permission that makes the check in
 * [StagedResidue] a name-by-name stat. Deletion therefore goes through a shell this app already has:
 * KernelSU's `su`, or the `shell`-uid server Shizuku provides, whose uid *owns* the directory.
 *
 * That is also the reason a sweep is never something the app waits for. A device with no shell has no
 * way to clean up, and asking for one - starting Shizuku, turning on wireless debugging - to delete a
 * few files would cost far more than the files are worth. So [sweepWhenQuiet] uses a shell that is
 * already answering and reports [SweepOutcome.NoShell] otherwise, and the files simply stay until
 * there is one.
 *
 * ## What it keeps: nothing, and that was checked rather than assumed
 *
 * The first version of this sweep spared the daemon and its stage file. The reason to take them too is
 * not that nothing wants the daemon - the payload's root helper does: it bind-mounts
 * `/data/local/tmp/ksud-s25u-kdp` over `logcat` and runs the late-load out of it. The reason is *when*
 * it wants it. That request is made by this app, as a step of the run, and the helper is otherwise a
 * plain socket server with no retry of its own - so by the time a run is over, the late-load has
 * happened and the file has no reader left.
 *
 * Nor does anything later in the boot need a copy: the module reload - the one repair action that
 * stages a daemon - copies the *installed* one out of `/data/adb/ksud` into
 * `/data/local/tmp/.ksud-stage` itself and refuses unless the two hash the same, and both restarts and
 * the soft reboot reach the daemon at that installed path. The transport all four run through is
 * KernelSU's own `su`, never a staged binary.
 *
 * Keeping the daemon would also have been the exemption that matters least where it counts: on a real
 * device `/data/local/tmp/ksud-s25u-kdp` is the largest thing this app leaves behind, and the first
 * name a detector prints.
 *
 * ## What it can and cannot report
 *
 * The sweep is one shell command that says what is there, deletes it, and says what is there
 * afterwards. What it cannot see it cannot report: the temp-su socket is denied to the `shell` domain
 * altogether, so `rm` fails on it and that failure is the only evidence there is. Both are carried, and
 * the app's own [StagedResidue] reading is left to say what is actually there now.

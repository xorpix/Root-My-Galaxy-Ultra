 * Reads KernelSU's module mounts from init's mount namespace.

 * Control being reachable is not the same as the module mounts being in place, and the two are
 * deliberately separate contracts: a run needs control, while anything that repairs or reloads
 * modules has to check its own mount result. That check cannot be made from wherever the command
 * happens to run, because module mounts are per-mount-namespace - the same reason a userspace
 * transition has to be asked of init rather than done from here. So the probe compares init's
 * namespace with its own, and enters init's when they differ, using `nsenter` if the device has it.
 *
 * The count comes from the modules themselves rather than from a list kept here: a module is expected
 * to be mounted when it is enabled and carries a `system` overlay, so installing or disabling one
 * changes the expectation without this app having to know which modules exist.

/**
 * What the read-only wall looks like wherever it is reported.
 *
 * It appears in three places - the run screen's failure card and both repair dialogs - and it is one
 * composable because of what it has to get right: the switch is named from its *own* label rather than
 * from a copy of the words, and the button that goes to it is the same button in all three. Written out
 * at each site, a rename of the setting would leave one of them naming a switch that no longer exists,
 * which is worse than saying nothing: it is a link to the wrong row.
 *
 * The lock rather than a warning icon on purpose. Nothing here is broken and nothing needs undoing - a
 * guard that the app's own run put up is working, and it is standing in the way of one thing the user
 * meant to do. A warning triangle would say the opposite.

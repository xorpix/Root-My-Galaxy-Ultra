/**
 * Why a catalog did not cover a device, in the terms someone can act on.
 *
 * "No compatible payload supports this model and kernel version" is the same sentence for a device
 * the feed has never heard of and for one whose firmware is a week newer than the last port, and only
 * one of those is worth waiting on. So the refusal names the identity that was searched for - which
 * the user can compare with the feed themselves - and the entries that came closest, which is what
 * says whether this is a gap of one build or of one whole model.
 *
 * The selection is here rather than in the repository so it can be tested without a network: what a
 * message says about a catalog is a rule, not a string.

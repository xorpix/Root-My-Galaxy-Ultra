/**
 * What a framework restart came back with.
 *
 * The restart is the one repair action whose result the app cannot report at the time, and for a
 * reason that is not a limitation of the app: `setprop ctl.restart zygote` answers whether init took
 * the property, and the framework that would have shown the answer is the thing being replaced. Every
 * other action reports itself in the dialog that started it; this one used to report only that the
 * request was made, which is the same thing the app says when init ignores it.
 *
 * So the restart's detached child stays behind and asks the phone what replaced the framework, and
 * writes down what it found where the app can read it without a shell - the app's own files directory,
 * which root may write and the app may read. The app reads that record when it next runs.

 *
 * - **A payload that needs a shell never falls back to the app's own domain.** The feed says a target
 *   only works from a shell context, which is a statement about what the payload can do there; running
 *   it as the app anyway would produce a failure that looks like the payload's fault. So the answer is
 *   null, and the run says which of the two transports it needed and what is wrong with each.
 * - **A usable Shizuku wins over a paired local ADB**, because a Shizuku session is already
 *   authenticated and needs no window in which wireless debugging is on - the local ADB path turns a
 *   device setting on and off around itself, which is worth avoiding when it does not have to happen.
 *   A *requested but unusable* Shizuku does not win: the point of asking is to get a shell, and a
 *   pairing that is actually there beats a preference that is not.
 *
 * Pure, so every combination can be checked without a device - which matters because the ones that go
 * wrong are the ones where two things are half-true at once.

/**
 * Whether the run's log is following its tail, and whether anything arrived while it was not.
 *
 * The panel used to scroll to the bottom on every line, which is right for watching a run and wrong for
 * reading one: an attempt to scroll back through a twelve-minute exploit was undone by the next line the
 * payload printed. So following is a state rather than a reflex - it stops the moment a person scrolls up,
 * starts again when they come back to the end, and while it is off the lines that arrive are counted as
 * missed so the panel can offer the way back down.
 *
 * Pure, and a value rather than three booleans, because the transitions are what matters: a scroll and a line
 * can arrive in either order, and the state after both has to be the same.

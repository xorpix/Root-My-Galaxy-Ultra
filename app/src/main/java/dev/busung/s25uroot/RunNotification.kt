/**
 * The run, in the shade.
 *
 * A run takes up to fifteen minutes and the phone is usually in a pocket while it does, which is the whole
 * reason this exists: the stage it has reached and the two things worth being able to do from there - stop it,
 * and keep what it has printed - without opening the app. The screen's own transport for stopping a run
 * already existed; the notification is what makes it reachable from where the person actually is.
 *
 * Deliberately not a foreground service. A run started from the screen runs in this app's own process, and
 * what keeps it alive is the process the user is looking at; promoting it to a service would be a promise this
 * change is not making - that a run survives the app being swiped away - and the app has never made it. What
 * this does promise is the two actions, and they work while the process does.
 *
 * One notification id, so every phase replaces the last rather than stacking. Cleared by the run itself, and
 * swept at launch: a notification whose run was killed with its process would otherwise sit there claiming an
 * install that is not happening, which is worse than no notification at all.

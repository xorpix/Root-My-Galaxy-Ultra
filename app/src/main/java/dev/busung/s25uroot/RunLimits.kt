 * slide — and the app hands those to the payload as environment variables. They are the payload's own
 * account of itself, and a setting that overrode them would be this app claiming to know better than
 * the thing doing the work, so there isn't one.
 *
 * What this app owns is the *stopping*: how long a whole run may take, how much silence means a stalled
 * payload, and how long one helper command may sit there. Those are the numbers a device and a boot
 * change — a cold device settles late, an overloaded one prints nothing for a while, a slow phone takes
 * longer over each step — so those are the ones worth a setting. They are also the ones whose failure is
 * *this app's* decision rather than the payload's, which is what makes them safe to move: a run that
 * reaches one is reported as a ceiling the user set, not as a payload that gave up.

 * The two ways a run that wanted Shizuku can go ahead anyway.
 *
 * One rule, written down once, because it is answered in two places that must not drift: the question
 * the run screen asks when Shizuku is not running, and the actions the boot notification carries when
 * its own wait for Shizuku ran out. A boot has nobody to ask, so it says what it could not do and hands
 * the same two answers to the notification - and what each answer *means* is decided here rather than at
 * either caller.
 *
 * [extra] is the value that travels in the intent, so a notification action and the screen that reads it
 * name the same thing rather than two strings that look alike.

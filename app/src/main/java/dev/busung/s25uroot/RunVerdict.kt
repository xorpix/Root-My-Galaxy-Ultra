/**
 * What a run came to, wherever it is shown.
 *
 * One vocabulary for four surfaces that used to disagree: Home's status card, the run screen's card, the
 * rows in History, and the notification in the shade. They had four mappings of their own between a result
 * and a colour, and the disagreement was not cosmetic - a failed run drew Home's card in the accent colour,
 * so the one screen a phone opens on said "fine" about a run that had just failed.
 *
 * The states are the ones the app already has rather than the ones a colour scheme would suggest: [RootOnly]
 * is a success that did not load KernelSU and is neither of the other two, and [Stopped] is a decision rather
 * than an outcome, which is why it is neutral rather than red.

/**
 * The three colours a surface needs for a verdict: what it sits on, what is written on that, and the accent
 * for anything drawn beside it.
 *
 * A pair rather than one colour because every surface here draws a container with text on it, and picking the
 * pair in four places is how one of them ends up with a combination that cannot be read. The accent is for
 * the glyphs and rules that are not on the container.
 *
 * Keyed to the theme's roles rather than to green, amber and red: this app's palette is generated from the
 * user's accent, so "the colour for success" is the accent and "the colour for a warning" is the tertiary role
 * - inventing literal hues here would be the fourth palette on a phone that has one.
 *
 * [RunVerdict.Running] wears the accent too, shared with [RunVerdict.Idle] and [RunVerdict.Succeeded]. It used to
 * wear the tertiary role, on the argument that a run in flight is a caution - and that argument does not survive
 * being looked at: a run going well is not a warning, and the card is the *install* button, the thing the screen
 * exists to offer. Painted in the warning hue it read as something having gone wrong on a screen where nothing
 * had. What tells a run in flight from a finished one is its own label, its icon and the progress bar, none of
 * which is a colour, and a hue that means "caution" is worth keeping for the cases that mean it.

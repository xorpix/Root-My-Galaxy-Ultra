/**
 * Whether the device is on Wi-Fi, which is the one thing wireless debugging waits for.
 *
 * Both of the routes that start Shizuku without root go through wireless debugging: this app's own adb
 * identity turns it on to be handed a shell to run Shizuku's starter in, and Shizuku's own start request
 * is answered by a build whose start method is wireless debugging. And wireless debugging cannot be up
 * without a connected Wi-Fi network - not by this app's rule, but by the framework's:
 * `AdbDebuggingManager` answers the enable message by writing `adb_wifi_enabled` back to 0 when there is
 * no current Wi-Fi access point, turns it off again on a Wi-Fi disconnect or a network change, and only
 * otherwise starts adbd's TLS thread. The port therefore cannot appear, and no amount of waiting
 * produces one.
 *
 * That is what turns "Shizuku has not arrived" into either "it has not had a chance yet" or a refusal
 * that names the reason. It is read and never changed: turning the radio on is not something a
 * third-party app can do - `setWifiEnabled` returns false for any caller that is not the system or a
 * privileged one - and the one command that can (`svc wifi enable`) needs the shell uid this app is
 * trying to obtain in the first place.

/**
 * The ways out of the running Android, with the ones this device cannot do left visible and greyed.
 *
 * Visible rather than hidden, because the answer to "why is Reboot to EDL not here" is not "it is not
 * supported" - it is that this phone has no root and no Shizuku shell at the moment, which is a state the
 * user can change. Each greyed row says which of the two is missing, since a grant in the KernelSU manager
 * and starting Shizuku are different fixes.
 *
 * What can be done is probed when the sheet opens and not before: both tiers are real commands, and asking
 * a device for a shell on every recomposition of a page would be paying for an answer nothing is reading.
 *
 * [notice] is a refusal the soft-restart shortcut already collected - it makes the same probe and asks for one
 * target, so there are cases where this sheet opens on something it would otherwise have to be told: a daemon
 * that answered and then refused. Read once, as the starting value of the line rather than as state that keeps
 * arriving, because a notice belongs to the attempt that produced it and not to the sheet.

/**
 * One target, as a row of the sheet.

 * The icon is the same for all six on purpose: they are one kind of action, and six different glyphs would
 * suggest six different kinds. The names separate them.
 *
 * It is the settings list's row, down to the `Card` and the shape it rests at: the same component, the same
 * paddings, the same 28dp glyph, and the same swell on press. A sheet of power actions is not a second list
 * with its own idea of what a row is - the reader has already learned this shape one screen over, and a second
 * curve for the same kind of thing is the kind of difference nobody can name and everybody notices.
 *
 * What each one does is **not** written underneath. It was, on the five that needed it, and it was removed for
 * the same reason a list of six rows does not need one: the names are already the whole of it - "Reboot to
 * Download" says what "Reboots into Download mode" said, one line later and twice the height. A *refusal* is a
 * different thing and stays, because the only question a row that cannot be pressed raises is what is missing.

/**
 * Where a tap on a notification about a run should land.
 *
 * A run has two lives and they are not in the same place. The live one is the run screen, whose state is in
 * the memory of the process running it - so it is the best screen when the tap arrives while that process
 * still has the run: the log panel, the Stop button, the step marks, the progress bar. It is no screen at
 * all once that process is gone, and it was never the boot gate's run, because the gate installs from
 * `:autoroot_gate` and the screens are in the UI process. Opening the run screen for a run it does not have
 * is worse than opening nothing: a fresh [InstallActivity] knows about no run, so it offers to start one -
 * a second install, offered by a notification that was describing the first.
 *
 * The other life is the run's own record: the history entry, written to disk as the run goes. It is live
 * while the run is running, complete once it has ended, and readable from any process, which is exactly the
 * set of things the run screen cannot promise.
 *
 * So a notification names the run it is about rather than the screen it wants, and the destination decides:
 * [liveRunIntent] is the run screen, which shows the named run when it is the one this process has and hands
 * off to the record when it is not, and [runRecordIntent] is the record itself, for a tap that arrives where
 * nothing can show the run - the boot gate's notification, whose run lives in another process entirely.
